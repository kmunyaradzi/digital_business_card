            silty loess of the <a class="tip"

            The rock that forms the butte is over 400 million years old, in
            Contrast with the 15-7 million year old
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River">Columbia

“islands” of ancient rock have come to be called buttes, a
butte being defined as a small hill with a flat top, whose width at
top does not exceed its height).</p>
<p>A hotel built by Cashup Davis stood atop Steptoe Butte from
1888 to 1908, burning down several years after it closed. In 1946,
Virgil McCroskey donated 120 acres (0.49 km2) of land to form
Steptoe Butte State Park, which was later increased to over 150
acres (0.61 km2). Steptoe Butte is currently recognized as a
National Natural Landmark because of its unique geological
value. It is named in honor of <a
